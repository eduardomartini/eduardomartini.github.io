  abstract = {We employ a resolvent-based methodology to estimate velocity and pressure fluctuations within turbulent channel flows at friction Reynolds numbers of approximately 180, 550 and 1000 using measurements of shear stress and pressure at the walls, taken from direct numerical simulation (DNS) databases. Martini et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 900, 2021, p. A2) showed that the resolvent-based estimator is optimal when the true space--time forcing statistics are utilised, thus providing an upper bound for the accuracy of any linear estimator. We use this framework to determine the flow structures that can be linearly estimated from wall measurements, and we characterise these structures and the estimation errors in both physical and wavenumber space. We also compare these results to those obtained using approximate forcing models -- an eddy-viscosity model and white-noise forcing -- and demonstrate the significant benefit of using true forcing statistics. All models lead to accurate results up to the buffer layer, but only using the true forcing statistics allows accurate estimation of large-scale logarithmic-layer structures, with significant correlation between the estimates and DNS results throughout the channel. The eddy-viscosity model displays an intermediate behaviour, which may be related to its ability to partially capture the forcing colour. Our results show that structures that leave a footprint on the channel walls can be accurately estimated using the linear resolvent-based methodology, and the presence of large-scale wall-attached structures enables accurate estimations through the logarithmic layer.},

  abstract = {Reactive flow control has been shown to be a promising tool to improve, among other aspects, the aerodynamic characteristics of an aircraft. This paper focuses on the use of reactive flow control to attenuate Tollmien-Schlichting (TS) waves over a wing profile. TS waves are an instability mechanism that is one of the first stages of boundary layer transition to turbulence. The Wiener-Hopf technique was used in this work for the experimental boundary layer control. The approach improves previous wave-cancellation techniques that, by constructing control kernels in the frequency domain, lead to control kernels with a noncausal part, i.e., actuation would need future sensor information to be constructed. In practical applications, it is unfeasible to access this type of information. Ignoring the noncausal part of the kernel leads to suboptimal solutions that might significantly degrade the performance of the controller. The Wiener-Hopf formalism allows us to take into account causality constraints in the formulation of the control problem, leading to an optimal realistic solution and a control kernel that is causal by construction. Moreover, it is possible to construct the control strategy based only on the power and cross-spectra obtained experimentally in a data-driven approach. The present work shows how to apply experimentally the Wiener-Hopf resolvent-based formalism using signals from a wind tunnel experiment, demonstrating that the TS waves can be effectively attenuated via a Wiener-Hopf-based controller, which yielded better results than a typical wave-cancellation approach.},

  abstract = {We present an experimental study of reactive control of turbulent jets, in which we target axisymmetric coherent structures, known to play a key role in the generation of sound. We first consider a forced jet, in which coherent structures are amplified above background levels, facilitating their detection, estimation and control. We then consider the more challenging case of an unforced jet. The linear control targets coherent structures in the region just downstream of the nozzle exit plane, where linear models are known to be appropriate for description of the lowest-order azimuthal modes of the turbulence. The control law is constructed in frequency space, based on empirically determined transfer functions. And the Wiener--Hopf formalism is used to enforce causality and to provide an optimal controller, as opposed to the sub-optimal control laws provided by simpler wave-cancellation methods. Significant improvements are demonstrated in the control of both forced and unforced jets. In the former case, order-of-magnitude reductions are achieved; and in the latter, turbulence levels are reduced by up to 60~\%. The results open new perspectives for the control of turbulent flow at high Reynolds number.},

  abstract = {Spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) is an increasingly popular modal analysis method in the field of fluid dynamics due to its specific properties: a linear system forced with white noise should have SPOD modes identical to response modes from resolvent analysis. The SPOD, coupled with the Welch method for spectral estimation, may require long time-resolved datasets. In this work, a linearised Ginzburg--Landau model is considered in order to study the method's convergence. Spectral proper orthogonal decomposition modes of the white-noise forced equation are computed and compared with corresponding response resolvent modes. The quantified error is shown to be related to the time length of Welch blocks (spectral window size) normalised by a convective time. Subsequently, an algorithm based on a temporal data shift is devised to further improve SPOD convergence and is applied to the Ginzburg--Landau system. Next, its efficacy is demonstrated in a numerical database of a boundary layer subject to bypass transition. The proposed approach achieves substantial improvement in mode convergence with smaller spectral window sizes with respect to the standard method. Furthermore, SPOD modes display growing wall-normal and spanwise velocity components along the streamwise direction, a feature which had not yet been observed and is also predicted by a global resolvent calculation. The shifting algorithm for the SPOD opens the possibility for using the method on datasets with time series of moderate duration, often produced by large simulations.},

The most expensive steps of the RSVD algorithm in the context of resolvent analysis, which constitute a bottleneck in its application to large systems, are replaced by leveraging the time-domain equations that have given rise to the resolvent operator. Specifically, the actions of the resolvent operator and its adjoint on a vector are obtained by equivalent direct and adjoint marching operations in the time domain. Our algorithm exploits streaming calculations to alleviate memory issues emerging for large systems, and we develop strategies to minimize the time-stepping cost while maintaining a desired level of accuracy. We validated our proposed algorithm by comparing the resolvent modes and gains of a Ginzburg-Landau model problem to those obtained from RSVD. Then, we use an axisymmetric jet and a three-dimensional extension thereof to assess and demonstrate the accuracy, cost, and memory efficiency of our new algorithm when applied to a high-dimensional system. In the three-dimensional case, we achieve orders-of-magnitude reduction in both CPU and memory usage compared to a direct application of RSVD.},

While the Navier--Stokes equations can be equivalently written using many different sets of dependent variables, we show that the properties of the linear operator obtained via linearisation about the mean depend on the variables in which the equations are written prior to linearisation, and can be modified under nonlinear transformation of variables. For example, we show that using primitive and conservative variables leads to differences in the singular values and modes of the resolvent operator for turbulent jets, and that the differences become more severe as variable-density effects increase. This lack of uniqueness of mean-flow-based linear analysis provides new opportunities for optimising models by specific choice of variables while also highlighting the importance of carefully accounting for the nonlinear terms that act as a forcing on the resolvent operator.},

Well-established solutions such as increasing the sampling rate or low-pass filtering to reduce aliasing can be prohibitively expensive for large datasets. This paper provides a set of alternative strategies for identifying and mitigating aliasing that are applicable even to large datasets. We show how time-derivative data, which can be obtained directly from the governing equations, can be used to detect aliasing and to turn the ill-posed problem of removing aliasing from data into a well-posed problem, yielding a prediction of the true spectrum. Similarly, we show how spatial filtering can be used to remove aliasing for convective systems. We also propose strategies to prevent aliasing when generating a database, including a method tailored for computing nonlinear forcing terms that arise within the resolvent framework. These methods are demonstrated using a nonlinear Ginzburg--Landau model and large-eddy simulation data for a subsonic turbulent jet.},

Recent studies show that linear wavepacket models can be employed for prediction of installation noise, which suggests that linear control strategies can also be adopted for mitigation of it. We present here a simple model to test different control approaches and highlight the potential restrictions on a successful noise control in an actual jet. The model contains all the essential elements for a realistic representation of the actual control problem: a stochastic wavepacket is obtained via a linear Ginzburg-Landau model; the effect of the wing trailing edge is accounted for by introducing a semi-infinite half plane near the wavepacket; and the actuation is achieved by placing a dipolar point source at the trailing edge, which models a piezoelectric actuator. An optimal causal resolvent-based control method is compared against the classical wave-cancellation method. The effect of the causality constraint on the control performance is tested by placing the sensor at different positions. We demonstrate that when the sensor is not positioned sufficiently upstream of the trailing edge, which can be the case for the actual control problem due to geometric restrictions, causality reduces the control performance. We also show that this limitation can be moderated using the optimal causal control together with modelling of the forcing.},

The study is motivated by the success of recent studies in applying this type of control on instability waves in transitional boundary layers and free-shear flows. Linear convective mechanisms in the initial region of turbulent jets are explored in order to perform reactive control, wherein the actuation signal is updated in real time based on sensor measurements performed upstream, resulting in an inverse feedforward approach. The control law is based on empirical transfer functions of the jet response to stochastic forcing and actuation, which are measured experimentally. Since turbulent jets have energy content spread in a number of azimuthal wave numbers, we apply axisymmetric forcing at the nozzle lip in order to be able to perform control using a reduced number of sensors and actuators. The external forcing produces axisymmetric wave packets which possess stochastic phases and amplitudes, akin to turbulent fluctuations found in unforced jets. We demonstrate the successful implementation of real-time reactive control of these disturbances, achieving order-of-magnitude attenuations of associated velocity fluctuations. Control is shown to reduce fluctuation levels over an extensive streamwise range.},

However, the absence of the free-stream acoustic modes in the V-S eigenspectrum is seldom pointed out in the literature. This family of modes is important if, for example, one is interested into the problems of sound emission or flow-acoustic interactions. In this work, it is shown how a distantly confined jet may be used as a surrogate problem for the free jet, in which the free-stream acoustic waves appear as a set of discrete modes. Comparing the modes observed in the free jet with those of the distantly confined jet, we show that other than the free-stream acoustic modes, the eigenvectors and eigenvalues converge exponentially with the wall distance. The proposed surrogate problem, thus, efficiently reproduces the dynamics of the original problem while accounting for the dynamics of the free-stream acoustic eigenmodes.},

Fluid Mech., vol. 825, 2017, pp. 1113--1152), we undertake a more general exploration of the physics associated with acoustic modes in jets and wakes, using a double vortex-sheet model. These acoustic modes are associated with eigenvalues of the vortex-sheet dispersion relation; they are discrete modes, guided by the vortex sheet; they may be either propagative or evanescent; and under certain conditions they behave in the manner of acoustic-duct modes. By analysing these modes we show how jets and wakes may both behave as waveguides under certain conditions, emulating ducts with soft or hard walls, with the vortex-sheet impedance providing effective `wall' conditions. We consider, in particular, the role that upstream-travelling acoustic modes play in the dispersion-relation saddle points that underpin the onset of absolute instability. The analysis illustrates how departure from duct-like behaviour is a necessary condition for absolute instability, and this provides a new perspective on the stabilising and destabilising effects of reverse flow, temperature ratio and compressibility; it also clarifies the differing symmetries of jet (symmetric) and wake (antisymmetric) instabilities. An energy balance, based on the vortex-sheet impedance, is used to determine stability conditions for the acoustic modes: these may become unstable in supersonic flow due to an energy influx through the shear layers. Finally, we construct the impulse response of flows with zero and finite shear-layer thickness. This allows us to show how the long-time wavepacket behaviour is indeed determined by interaction between Kelvin--Helmholtz and acoustic modes.},

Fluid Mech., vol. 883, 2020, A17) to obtain optimal, non-causal estimates of time-varying flow quantities from low-rank measurements. We derive optimal transfer functions between the measurements and certain nonlinear terms that act as a forcing on the linearised Navier--Stokes equations, and show that the resulting transfer function to the flow state is equivalent to a multiple-input, multiple-output Wiener filter if the colour of the forcing statistics is known. A matrix-free implementation is developed based on integration of the direct and adjoint linearised Navier--Stokes operators, enabling application to the large systems encountered for transitional and turbulent flows without the need for a priori model reduction. Using a linearised Ginzburg--Landau problem, we show that the non-casual resolvent-based method outperforms a casual Kalman filter for general sensor configurations and recovers the Kalman filter transfer function in specific cases, leading to causal estimates at a significantly reduced computational cost. Additionally, our method is shown to be more accurate and robust than popular approaches based on truncation of the resolvent operator to its leading modes. The applicability of the method to transitional and turbulent flows is demonstrated via application to a (linearised) transitional boundary layer and a (nonlinear) turbulent channel flow. Errors on the order of 2 \% are achieved for the boundary layer, and the channel flow case highlights the need to account for the forcing colour to achieve accurate flow estimates. In practice, our method can be used as a post-processing tool to reconstruct unmeasured quantities from limited experimental data, and, in cases where the transfer function can be accurately truncated to its causal components, as a low-cost estimator for flow control.},

  abstract = {Resolvent analysis of the linearized Navier--Stokes equations provides useful insight into the dynamics of transitional and turbulent flows and can provide a model for the dominant coherent structures within the flow, particularly for flows where the linear operator selectively amplifies one particular force component, known as the optimal force mode. Force and response modes are typically obtained from a singular-value decomposition of the resolvent operator. Despite recent progress, the cost of resolvent analysis for complex flows remains considerable, and explicit construction of the resolvent operator is feasible only for simplified problems with a small number of degrees of freedom. In this paper we propose two new matrix-free methods for computing resolvent modes based on the integration of the linearized equations and the corresponding adjoint system in the time domain. Our approach achieves an order of magnitude speedup when compared with previous matrix-free time-stepping methods by enabling all frequencies of interest to be computed simultaneously. Two different methods are presented: one based on analysis of the transient response, providing leading modes with fine frequency discretization; and another based on the steady-state response to periodic forcing, providing optimal and suboptimal modes for a discrete set of frequencies. The methods are validated using a linearized Ginzburg--Landau equation and applied to the three-dimensional flow around a parabolic body.},

  abstract = {The application of control tools to complex flows frequently requires approximations, such as reduced-order models and/or simplified forcing assumptions, where these may be considered low rank or defined in terms of simplified statistics (e.g. white noise). In this work we propose a resolvent-based control methodology with causality imposed via a Wiener--Hopf formalism. Linear optimal causal estimation and control laws are obtained directly from full-rank, globally stable systems with arbitrary disturbance statistics, circumventing many drawbacks of alternative methods. We use efficient, matrix-free methods to construct the matrix Wiener--Hopf problem, and we implement a tailored method to solve the problem numerically. The approach naturally handles forcing terms with space--time colour; it allows inexpensive parametric investigation of sensor/actuator placement in scenarios where disturbances/targets are low rank; it is directly applicable to complex flows disturbed by high-rank forcing; it has lower cost in comparison to standard methods; it can be used in scenarios where an adjoint solver is not available; or it can be based exclusively on experimental data. The method is particularly well suited for the control of amplifier flows, for which optimal control approaches are typically robust. Validation of the approach is performed using the linearized Ginzburg--Landau equation. Flow over a backward-facing step perturbed by high-rank forcing is then considered. Sensor and actuator placement are investigated for this case, and we show that while the flow response downstream of the step is dominated by the Kelvin--Helmholtz mechanism, it has a complex, high-rank receptivity to incoming upstream perturbations, requiring multiple sensors for control.},

These concepts are explored in five different examples, highlighting and illustrating the different code capabilities, including mesh masking, mapping, imposition of boundary constraints, and the analysis of periodic flows using Cartesian or axisymmetric coordinates. These examples were constructed to be a departure point for studying other flows.},

  abstract = {Different transition to turbulence routes for the flow around blunt bodies are possible. Non-modal amplification of perturbations via the lift-up effect has recently been explored to explain transition near the stagnation point in axisymmetric bodies. However, only perturbations already present in the boundary layer can be amplified, and the mechanisms by which free-stream perturbations enter the boundary layer have not yet been fully explored. In this study, we present an investigation of how disturbances enter the boundary layer via the stagnation point. This linear mechanism is expected to dominate over non-linear mechanisms previously identified on the formation of boundary layer perturbations at low turbulence intensity levels. A parametric investigation is presented, revealing trends with Reynolds and Mach numbers.},

  abstract = {An analysis of the statistics of the nonlinear terms in resolvent analysis is performed in this work for turbulent Couette flow at Reynolds number 400. Data from a direct numerical simulation of a minimal flow unit is used to compute the covariance matrix of the velocity. From the same data, we computed the nonlinear terms of the Navier--Stokes equations (treated as forcing), which allowed us to compute the covariance matrix of the forcing. The quantitative relation between the two covariances via the resolvent operator is confirmed here for the first time, accounting for relevant signal processing issues related to the windowing procedure for frequency-domain quantities. Such exact correspondence allowed the eduction of the most relevant force components for the dominant structures in this flow, which participate in the self-sustaining cycle of turbulence: (i) streamwise vortices and streaks, and (ii) spanwise-coherent fluctuations of spanwise velocity. The results show a dominance by a subset of the nonlinear terms for the prediction of the full statistics of streamwise vortices and streaks; a single term is seen to be dominant for spanwise motions. A relevant feature observed in these cases is that the forcing covariance is dominated by its first eigenfunction, showing that nonlinear terms also have a coherent structure at low frequencies in this flow. Different forcing components are also coherent between them, which leads to constructive and destructive interferences that greatly modify the flow response. These are key features of forcing `colour' for the present flow.},

  abstract = {here is currently considerable interest in the guided-jet mode, as a result of recent works demonstrating it being the upstream component of various resonant systems in high-speed flows. For given jet operating conditions, the mode is known to exist over only a finite-frequency range that, for a twin-jet system, has been observed to vary with both jet separation and solution symmetry. Vortex-sheet and finite-thickness linear stability models are here employed to consider the behaviour of the guided-jet mode as the two jets are brought together, for both a planar and round twin-jet system. It is demonstrated that in both cases as the twin-jet system merges it forms a higher-order mode of an equivalent single-jet geometry. This then imposes a constraint on the guided-jet mode as the finite-frequency range must change to meet that of the equivalent geometry the system merges to, explaining the previously observed dependence on jet separation.},
