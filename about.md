Enthusiastic about science, technology, and on the constant lookout for new creative ideas.

With backgrounds in physics, engineering, complex systems, I spend ~7 years in the space and aeronautical industries developing high-performance products before returning to academia to study fluid mechanics while managing an enginering consulting company. As an assistant professor, I am developing fundamental research in fluid-structure interaction, oriented for long-term applications on  sustainable projects, such as wind energy harvesting.
