TURB-Cab is an [ANR](https://www.anr.fr) project, aiming to study the dynamics of suspended cabins in the presence of turbulent flows. The project is lead by ISAE-ENSMA & Institut Pprime, in a colaborations with LHEEA, CSTB, LPENSL, Doppelmayr, POMA, MND FRANCE, and STRMTG, aiming to improve safety standards, paving the way for the use of suspended cabins as an urban transportation method.


## **TURB-Cab: Enhancing Cable Transport Comfort and Safety**

**Project Overview**

The TURB-Cab project aims to improve the comfort, performance, and safety of cable transport systems in urban environments. By investigating the complex interactions between cable car cabins and turbulent winds, the project seeks to develop innovative solutions to mitigate oscillations and enhance overall passenger experience.

**Key Objectives**

1. **Understand Fluid-Structure Interactions:** Gain a deep understanding of the mechanisms governing the interaction between cable car cabins and turbulent winds.
2. **Develop a Stability Qualification Methodology:** Establish a comprehensive framework to assess the stability of cabins under various wind conditions.
3. **Propose Control Strategies:** Explore and implement effective strategies to suppress oscillations and enhance cabin stability.

**Research Approach**

The project will employ a multi-faceted approach, combining experimental investigations, numerical simulations, and reduced-order modeling. Key activities include:

* **Experimental Studies:** Conduct wind tunnel experiments to investigate the dynamics of cable car cabins under different wind conditions and turbulence intensities.
* **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD):** Utilize high-fidelity CFD simulations to model the complex fluid-structure interactions between cabins and turbulent flows.
* **Reduced-Order Modeling (ROM):** Develop simplified models to efficiently analyze and predict cabin behavior under various scenarios.

**Expected Outcomes**

The TURB-Cab project is expected to deliver the following outcomes:

* **In-depth Understanding:** A comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing cable car stability in turbulent environments.
* **Stability Qualification Methodology:** A practical framework for assessing the stability of cable car systems.
* **Innovative Control Strategies:** Effective methods to mitigate oscillations and enhance passenger comfort.

**Project Impact**

The successful completion of TURB-Cab will have significant implications for the cable transport industry. By improving the comfort, safety, and efficiency of cable car systems, the project will contribute to the development of more sustainable and enjoyable urban transportation solutions.
