TurbCab is an [ANR](https://www.anr.fr) project, aiming to study the dynamics of suspended cabins in the presence of turbulent flows. The project is a partnership between ISAE-ENSMA and regulatory bodies, aiming to improve safety standards, paving the way for the use of suspended cabins as an urban transportation method.
