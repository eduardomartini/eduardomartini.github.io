# Motivation

Aeroacoustics has two main elements. The fundamental science behind it is acoustics, a branch of fluid mechanics. The “aero” part is due to the application: the study of acoustic phenomena in aerodynamical systems.

In this “aeroacoustic” course, we assume no prior knowledge of acoustics. As “acoustics” is a prerequisite to the study of “aeroacoustics”, we need to cover both. We will try to motivate the theorical acoustics concepts with concrete aeroacoustics problems, which will naturally need to be simplified.

This course was created, and currently given, in collaboration with Peter Jordan, and is partially based on previous courses given by Profs. V. Jaunet, V. Fortuné, and Y. Gervays at ISAE-ENSMA.
