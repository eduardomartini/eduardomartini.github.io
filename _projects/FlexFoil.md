FlexFoil is an [ANR](https://www.anr.fr) JCJC (Young talent) project, aiming to leverage the structural flexibility to reduce trailing-edge noise, avoiding typical shortcomings of previous approaches, such as loss of aerodynamical performance.

The project aims to develop numerical tools for simulating and optimizing fluid-structure interaction (FSI) systems.
