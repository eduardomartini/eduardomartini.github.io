FlexFoil is an [ANR](https://www.anr.fr) JCJC (Young talent) project, aiming to leverage the structural flexibility to reduce trailing-edge noise, avoiding typical shortcomings of previous approaches, such as loss of aerodynamical performance.
 
## **FlexFoil**

**Project Overview**
The project aims to push the boundaries of airfoil design by exploring the potential of flexible structures to significantly reduce noise emissions. This groundbreaking research seeks to address the pressing issue of noise pollution associated with wind turbines and other applications involving airfoils.

By leveraging advanced computational modeling and innovative design techniques, FlexFoil will investigate the complex interplay between turbulence and flexible structures. 


**Key Objectives**

* __Develop High-Fidelity Simulations__: Creating accurate numerical models to simulate the coupled dynamics of turbulence and flexible airfoils.
* __Create Reduced-Order Models__: Developing simplified models that capture the essential features of TFI for efficient design and optimization.
* __Understanding Turbulence-Flexibility Interaction (TFI)__: Delving into the fundamental mechanisms that govern the interaction between turbulent flows and flexible structures.
* __Design of Tailored Airfoil Structures__: Exploring novel airfoil geometries and materials to optimize noise reduction while maintaining aerodynamic performance.

The project builds upon existing knowledge in fluid-structure interaction, airfoil noise, and turbulence modeling. By combining these disciplines, the project aims to make significant contributions to the field of aeroacoustics and sustainable energy.
